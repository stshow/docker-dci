# docker-dci
A script to deploy Docker Certified Infrastructure labs

To Do: 

    1. Add support for CentOS/RHEL7/SLES/Ubuntu 18.04 (Currently only Ubuntu 16.04 is used).
    2. Script currently requires at least 1 DTR node. Fix this. 
    3. Support for specific docker versions instead of latest in branch.
